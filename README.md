# PM Product Questions

This is a starter guide to PM Interview Product Questions. These questions help an interviewer evaluate a candidate's ability to design, build and improve products. 

I'll be refrencing Cracking the PM Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell and Jackie Bavaro a lot throughout this post and would highly reccommend getting a copy of their book if you are even remotely interested in a PM role. 

# Common Product Interview Questions
```
1. How would you design _________? 
2. What would you improve about ____________?
3. Whatâ€™s your favorite product and why?
```

I can attest to the commonality of these questions. I had one of these type of questions in nearly every interview I had at Microsoft. 

Definitely add product research to your list of pre-interview prep. Have a "favorite" product that you not only have in depth knowledge of on its own, but also the subject area it occupies. For example, at Microsoft, I chose to do my prep work on the Halolens. I was intertested in the VR space and felt I could have an indepth conversation about the state of MR/AR/VR and various loosely related competitors in the space such as Oculus. 

This conversation doesn't have to get too technical, however, showing a mastery in a particular area can guide the interviewer towards feeling that if you are capable of gaining an in depth understanding in this subject area, that could translate into theirs as well. Bonus points if you are able to show technical mastery of the area you are applying for, but I have to warn you, be very careful in selecting a product that might hit a little too close to home for the interviewer. It will not only be extremely difficult to show mastery in front of a likely senior higing manager, your comments for improvement might not be warmly recieved. 

Although these more senior employees are without a doubt accustomed to criticism on their products or ideas, this is just an added variable that would likely be best to avoid when this is your first conversation with this individual. 

# STEP 1: Understand the Problem

Ask all the questions you can think of about the uses, communitity, consumer, and resources.

This is your first step in showing the interviewer that you are throurough and can have an organized thought process.

These Product Questions are deceiving complex. You could be asked to design a cup, however if you did not clarify, you wouldn't know that this cup needs to hold a liquid on the International Space Station for Astronauts in zero gravity. That is why fully understanding the problem is absolutely essential to being successful.

# STEP 2: Provide a Structure
If you aren't coming from a previous PM position or Kingergarten class room, this step might be a bit difficult to start doing at first. However, this is a skill that, when properly developed, will help you and your audience get the most out of every conversation. 

Here is an example of providing structure in the context of this interview:
```
First I am going to talk about the goals.
Then, I am going to list out some potential features against these goals.
Ok, so starting with the goals...
```

This helps the interviewer follow along easier and will be useful in any future PM venture. 

# STEP 3: Identify the Users and Customers

This is one of the best areas to take a second and drill down into since it will drive the remainder of your steps/design.

Diego, a PM at Microsoft, does a great video on getting a proper framework for this. Starting with certain age groups, occupations, and drivrrs, really helps you reate a unique problem set that will allow for narrowed distinctions instead of broad and wandering solutions.  

# STEP 4: Use Cases

# STEP 5: How well is this product currently doing for our use cases?

# STEP 6: Feature changes or potential weak spots

# STEP 7: Wrap it up. Reiterate your points.
